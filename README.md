2048 AI is an artificial intelligence developed to win the logic game [2048](https://2048game.com/). Based on the Monte Carlo method, the program generates predictions for each move using two parameters: width, the number of predictions per move, and depth, the reach of each prediction. Based on the collected data from each prediction, the next move is decided.

### Run AI:
- To use the AI, simply copy the code from the `2048_AI.js` file, access the [2048](https://2048game.com/), paste the code into the browser console, and press Enter to play.

- The second option is to use `2048_simulation.js`, which is a restructured version of the class to allow testing different widths and depths. To run this model, you just need Node.js.
